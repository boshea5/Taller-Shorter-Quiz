## The Taller Shorter Ireland Quiz

A quiz that asks players random questions relating to the Tallest and Shortest phenomena in Ireland. 

The quiz is designed to test the knowledge of the user by giving them four options. The concept is to make the user think of the concept of "tallest and shortest" as not just a human concept but a physical one too. The quiz also will concentrate on lesser known areas of Ireland.

The Colors selected are those that match the Irish Flag Green, White and Orange along with Gold as an extra color.
